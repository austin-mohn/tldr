  <h1>TL;DR: Smart Summarization for Group Chats</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p><strong>TL;DR</strong> is a dialogue summarization project created to address information overload in group messaging applications such as Acme Communications. It uses transformer-based models like BART and PEGASUS to generate concise, relevant summaries of lengthy conversations. This allows users to catch up on discussions without reading every individual message.</p>

  <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Users typically spend between 8 and 12 minutes catching up after being away.</li>
    <li>Around 60 percent of surveyed users report missing important content.</li>
    <li>There has been a 15 percent decline in engagement from users who feel overwhelmed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The challenge is to retain key content while filtering out noise and repetition.</p>

  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>This project introduces an intelligent summarization tool that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Extracts high-value content such as decisions, questions, and answers.</li>
    <li>Produces readable summaries that save time and reduce fatigue.</li>
    <li>Uses fine-tuned transformer models trained on annotated group chats.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The goal is to make group messaging more accessible, especially for users who check in intermittently.</p>

  <h2>Technical Approach</h2>

  <h3>Data Preparation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Chat logs were cleaned and normalized.</li>
    <li>Message segments were paired with corresponding human-written summaries.</li>
    <li>A WordPiece tokenizer compatible with BERT was applied.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Model Selection</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Transformer architectures were evaluated, and BART was selected.</li>
    <li>Training involved ROUGE-based reinforcement learning.</li>
    <li>Fine-tuning was performed using the HuggingFace Transformers library.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Evaluation Strategy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L metrics were used to assess overlap and structure.</li>
    <li>Humans assessed clarity, relevance, and coherence.</li>
    <li>Latency benchmarks targeted summary generation in under one second per 100 messages.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>Initial outputs suggest strong alignment with project goals. Model performance approached the target ROUGE scores of 0.45 and above. Summaries were generated efficiently and aligned well with human-written references in sample evaluations.</p>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <p>To run this project, you will need the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Python 3.8 or higher</li>
    <li>HuggingFace Transformers</li>
    <li>PyTorch or TensorFlow</li>
    <li>nltk, pandas, scikit-learn</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To install dependencies, use the following command:</p>
  <pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></pre>
